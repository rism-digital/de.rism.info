# Publications

The results of the work of the RISM Working Group Germany are freely accessible in the RISM Catalogue (opac.rism.info).
In addition, catalogue printouts generated from the database were produced for selected holdings, which were originally intended primarily for the institutions that own them. Since 2009, some of these catalogues have been made available as PDF files in the series ‘Musikhandschriften in Deutschland. Kataloge ausgewählter Sammlungen’ (Music Manuscripts in Germany. Catalogues of Selected Collections) on the Saxon document and publication server ‘Qucosa’. Individual catalogues are also available in book form as volumes of other series (see below).
