Funding for the German RISM offices by the Union of Academies of Sciences and Humanities, under the leadership of the Academy of Sciences and Literature in Mainz, is currently coming to an end.

The Dresden office will remain active until the end of 2026. The Munich office will be restructured in 2026 and will gradually take over some of the tasks of the Editorial Centre in the newly created RISM Editorial Network. The staff in Munich will also be available to the international RISM community for advice on sources and source-related questions. The SLUB Dresden, the SBB Berlin and the Akademie der Wissenschaften und der Literatur Mainz will take on further tasks within the framework of the Editorial Network.

The RIdIM database will continue to be maintained by the Bavarian State Library.
