# Locations and holdings

Details on the status of cataloguing music manuscripts in German libraries and archives can be found in the overview linked below. It will be gradually supplemented with more detailed information on the individual locations and source holdings.

In 2009, the German working group began publishing [its own catalogues](link) for selected collections. These catalogues are summarised excerpts from the RISM Catalog. However, the most up-to-date data is only available in the [RISM Catalog](https://opac.rism.info "Öffnet externen Link in neuem Fenster"){:blank}.

The map gives an overview of the current state of the collections in RISM. After you click on a point on the map, a menu on the left-hand side opens where you can see the number of records in RISM and the cataloging status (green = completed, yellow = in process, red = unprocessed).
